# MarketSage: An AI-Powered Stock Prediction System

MarketSage is an AI-driven application that predicts future stock prices using a hybrid model combining **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Transformer** neural networks. The system is designed to provide comprehensive investment analysis and actionable insights for retail investors, all presented through a polished web interface built with Streamlit.

-----

## 🚀 Key Features

  * **Hybrid Model:** Leverages the strengths of both LSTM (for sequential data) and Transformer (for attention mechanisms) models to provide robust price predictions.
  * **Comprehensive Analysis:** Generates a detailed report including key insights, risk factors, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, EMAs), and a clear investment outlook.
  * **AI-Powered Insights:** Integrates with the Google Gemini API to produce a narrative, professional-grade financial analysis.
  * **Intuitive UI:** A clean and interactive dashboard built with Streamlit allows users to select a stock, view historical data, and see future predictions with custom charts and metrics.
  * **Local Execution:** All models are trained and run locally, ensuring data privacy and offline functionality.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### Gemini Prompt Customization

**`prompts/gemini.txt`** is the template file for the Gemini AI prompt. You can edit this file to customize the analysis generated by Gemini. The app will automatically load and format this prompt using the latest stock data and technical indicators.

**How to use:**

1. Edit `prompts/gemini.txt` to change the wording, structure, or requested analysis. Use curly braces `{}` for variables, e.g. `{company_name}`, `{current_price}`, `{RSI}`.
2. The app will fill in these variables automatically. Supported variables include:
  - `company_name`, `symbol`, `current_price`, `sector`, `model_accuracy`, `predictions_1_week_gain_pct`, `predictions_1_month_gain_pct`, `RSI`, `MACD`, `MACD_Signal`, `EMA20`, `EMA50`, `ATR`, `recommendation_score`
3. After editing, simply refresh the Streamlit app. No code changes are needed.

**Example snippet from `prompts/gemini.txt`:**

```text
As a senior financial analyst, provide a comprehensive investment analysis for {company_name} ({symbol}).

Analyze the following data points:
- Current Price: ₹{current_price:.2f}
- RSI: {RSI:.1f}
- ...
```

**Tip for developers:**
- You can add or remove sections, change the report structure, or request different types of analysis by editing this file.
- If you add new variables, make sure they are available in the app code (see `render_gemini_insights` in `app.py`).

  * `src/`: Contains the main application and training scripts (`app.py` for Streamlit dashboard, `main.py` for model training).
  * `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model prototyping, and testing.
  * `saved_models/`: The primary directory for storing all trained models and their associated data (scalers, metadata, etc.). Each stock symbol has its own subdirectory.
  * `.env.example`: A template for environment variables, specifically for your Gemini API key.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the MarketSage application on your local machine.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project from GitHub and navigate into the main directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lazy-coder-03/MarketSage.git
cd MarketSage
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(**Note:** A `requirements.txt` file is required for this step. If it doesn't exist, you can generate one from the provided code by listing the libraries you see: `streamlit`, `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `plotly`, `python-dotenv`, `google-generativeai`.)*

### Step 3: Train the Models

Before you can run the web app, you need to train a model for a specific stock. The `main.py` script is set up to train a model for **RELIANCE.NS** by default.

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This script will:

1.  Download historical data for `RELIANCE.NS`.
2.  Preprocess the data and add technical indicators.
3.  Train both an LSTM and a Transformer model.
4.  Find the optimal weight for the hybrid model.
5.  Save the trained models, scaler, and metadata to the `saved_models/RELIANCE.NS` directory.

You can change the `SYMBOL` variable in `main.py` to train models for other stocks, such as `"TCS.NS"` or `"SBIN.NS"`.

### Step 4: Configure the Gemini API (Optional but Recommended)

For the "AI Market Insights" section to work, you need a Google Gemini API key.

1.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
2.  Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3.  Add your key to the `.env` file.

<!-- end list -->

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Step 5: Run the Web Application

With the models trained and the API key configured, you can now launch the Streamlit app.

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

This will start a local web server and open the MarketSage dashboard in your default web browser. You can then select the stock model you just trained from the sidebar.
